lily's terrible balatro mod!

### Jokers
There are over 120 new jokers, all as unique as possible!

### Consumables
5 new types of consumables: planetoids, superplanets, cataclysm, aesthetic, and tauic spectral cards!

Planetoids are simply better variants of planet cards, and superplanets are extremely powerful, but very rare planet cards.

Cataclysm cards are consumables with a massive upside and downside, they can help greatly, or make you lose if you aren't careful.

Aesthetic cards apply vatiotus editions to jokers.

Tauic Spectral cards are rare, empowered versions of the normal Spectral cards.

### Decks
6 new decks!

### Mechanics
There are some new mechanics to understand in VallKarri.
If you score *way* too much on the boss blind, your blinds will get much more difficult.

Hand buffs, which benefit the player if they play a specific amount of enhanced cards.

There's also leveling, many things will give xp, including playing on higher stakes, and you gain small bonuses based on your level!
